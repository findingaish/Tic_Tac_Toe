# Tic_Tac_Toe
This GitHub repository hosts a project that implements a Tic Tac Toe game using Verilog and GTK Wave for waveform visualization. Tic Tac Toe is a classic game played on a grid of 3x3 squares. The goal of the game is for players to strategically place their symbols (usually X and O) in a row, column, or diagonal to win the game.
