Tic Tac Toe Game

The Tic Tac Toe Game project is an implementation of the classic two-player game using Verilog hardware description language. The game allows players to choose between the symbols 'X' and 'O' and compete on a 3x3 grid. The objective is to mark a straight line of the same symbol either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally to win the game.

This project takes advantage of Verilog to design and simulate the game logic. The code includes modules for position registers, winner detection, illegal move detection, and a finite state machine (FSM) controller. These components work together to enable player moves, computer moves, and determine the game's outcome.

Features
Player vs. Player mode: Two players can compete against each other on the game board.
Player vs. Computer mode: Players can challenge a computer-controlled opponent.
Intelligent move detection: The system detects and prevents illegal moves, ensuring fair gameplay.
Winner detection: The game checks for winning combinations and declares the winner.
Visualization with GTK Wave: The Verilog simulation can be visualized using GTK Wave to observe the waveform and analyze the game's behavior.

Future Enhancements
Here are some ideas for future enhancements and expansions of the Tic Tac Toe Game project:

Implement the game on an FPGA board: Use the Verilog code and Logisim circuit design to create an electronic version of the game that runs on an FPGA board.
Improve user interface: Develop a graphical user interface (GUI) to provide a visually appealing and user-friendly experience for players.
Add AI opponents: Implement more sophisticated AI algorithms to create computer opponents with different difficulty levels.
Multiplayer support: Enable network connectivity to allow players to compete against each other online.
Extend the game board size: Increase the size of the game board to support larger grids, providing additional challenges for players.
Feel free to explore and expand upon these ideas to take your Tic Tac Toe Game project to new heights!
